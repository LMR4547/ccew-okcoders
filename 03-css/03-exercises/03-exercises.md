OK Coders: Lesson 3 Exercises
====

Complete all homework assignments before coming to the next class or as otherwise instructed.

## Create an express app for css practice

**Create a new express app**

Similar to the previous homework assignment, create a new Express web application. Do not reuse previous express applications. The intent is to practice using the command line and creating applications from scratch quickly.

**Grab the html and css from this repository**

Copy all the html files from the public directory in this repository into the public directory of your express application. Don't forget to copy the files from the public/stylesheets directory into the public/stylesheets directory in your Express application.

**Fill in the css**

Each file includes html and content that is already marked up with id and class attributes. But the style definitions are missing! Add style definitions so that each documents appears as it should. Refer to the comments in each html file for further instructions.

## Review css selectors and properties

Mozilla has excellent css documention. Review the properties list and make sure you understand selectors. We'll be using them with JavaScript as well.

## Make sure you understand flexbox

[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) has a great Flexbox tutorial. Take the time and make sure you understand it! It makes your life easier!

## Continue reviewing material on the command line and git

Two free books on the command line and on git were mentioned in class. Consider these books textbooks and study them.

[The Linux Command Line, by William Shots](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) : Read past the first four chapters. Start to get into the advanced material likes pipes and redirection.

[Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) : Make sure you have read the first two chapters, Getting Started and Git Basics, and begin working on branching in chapter three.

## Continue learning JavaScript

We start JavaScript programming next week! Make sure you come to class prepared. We will use the excellent and free [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) for this class.

Read and practice with the first four chapters by the beginning of next week. Don't put this off!
